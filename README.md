My second attempt at creating telegram bots. This project should have been used in a real business project. There you can a good quality code (since I'm a beginner), a database (SQLite3) and an admin pannel. The bot collects the IDs of all the users that ever used the boy so you can spam them any messages (I know that spamming is a bad practice, but it's legit in this case because the target of the audience of the business project). Also the admin can change some info the users of the bot are looking for.
